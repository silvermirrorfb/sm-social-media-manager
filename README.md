# Silver Mirror Social Media Manager

AI-powered Instagram DM handling, comment moderation, and social media management for Silver Mirror Facial Bar.

## What It Does

### Instagram DMs
- Automatically responds to direct messages using Claude AI with the full Silver Mirror knowledge base (10 locations, services, pricing, skin concern recommendations)
- Smart routing: membership questions → memberships@, collaborations → Sierra, complaints → location phone, etc.
- Handles voice messages, images, and non-text messages gracefully
- Auto-escalates to human after 4 unresolved exchanges

### Comment Moderation (Aggressive Mode)
- Classifies every comment: positive, negative, spam, question, profanity, competitor, political, off-topic, scam
- **Aggressive moderation**: hides anything not clearly positive
- Replies to positive comments with warm, on-brand responses (30 pre-built templates)
- Hides + flags legitimate complaints for human review with severity levels
- Tracks spam count per user — auto-blocks after 3 spam comments in 30 days
- Confidence-based thresholds: auto-action at ≥85%, human review queue for 50-84%

### Logging & Monitoring
- Every DM and moderation action logged to Google Sheets with 12 columns
- Confidence scores, severity, triggers, and human review flags tracked
- Dashboard for quick status checks
